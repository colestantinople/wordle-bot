He solves the daily wordle.

## Uses:
 * Node.js
 * puppeteer for DOM manipulation.
 * Python to generate the wordlist from a text file extract
 * TypeScript

## TODO:
 * Generate sharable output (i.e. square emojis)
 * Handle multiple letters better (i.e. keep count of the maximumn amount of letters that could be in one word)
 * Prefer all-unique-letter words (i.e. try to choose an all-unique word; if none exist, choose from what we have)
 * Set up a license
